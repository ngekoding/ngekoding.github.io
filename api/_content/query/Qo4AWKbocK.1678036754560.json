It is also equipped with a search feature based on chunks of verses, coloring of the Tajweed rules and audio recitation that can be played in various modes. In addition, verses and translations can be copied for any purpose. \n\nThis application was inspired by the number of Quran applications in the market that display inappropriate advertisements, so the idea came to create a Quran application that is completely free without any advertisements at all. Thus, it is hoped that we can still be solemn when reading the Quran.","_id":"content:work:5.quran-id.yaml","_type":"yaml","_source":"content","_file":"work/5.quran-id.yaml","_extension":"yaml"}
