The implementation also becomes more controllable because it can be monitored through the service, and can meet the applicable rules. For example, it is determined that the maximum overtime in 1 week is 12 hours, so that when applying from the service there will be a validation process first, this is so that in the payment phase the employee concerned is not disadvantaged if he exceeds the time limit.\n\nFrom the supervisor's side, it can also be easier to know the total expenditure of overtime and who is working overtime, which can help in making further decisions, for example related to the intensity of work and the quality of employee work.","_id":"content:work:4.ulem.yaml","_type":"yaml","_source":"content","_file":"work/4.ulem.yaml","_extension":"yaml"}
