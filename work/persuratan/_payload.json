Thus it can cover all the different requirements based on the purpose of the document.","content:en:work:1.persuratan.yaml","yaml","content","en/work/1.persuratan.yaml",[41,42],null,{"_path":43,"title":44,"thumbnail":45},"/work/simadang","Sistem Administrasi Undangan","/img/works/simadang/thumbnail.png",{"_path":4,"title":8,"thumbnail":18},{"_path":48,"title":49,"thumbnail":50},"/work/berbagi-catatan","Berbagi Catatan","/img/works/berbagi-catatan/thumbnail.png",1702302800731]
