I'm Nur Muhammad, and I'm passionate about creating innovative web-based solutions that make people's lives easier. My love for web development began in 2012 when I first saw my senior write HTML code with the &lt;marquee&gt; tag on the blackboard. I was fascinated by how technology could be used to make things happen on the internet.

Today, I spend my days writing code and creating projects both for my job and personal endeavors. These projects allow me to explore my creativity and improve my skills, all with the intention of developing solutions that are relevant and valuable to others.
